# SportObjectDetection-YOLOv8

Welcome to the `SportsVision-YOLOv8` repository, where we have fine-tuned the YOLO v8 model for specific sports object detection tasks. Our models are tailored for two popular sports: Soccer and Ice Hockey.

## Models

### Soccer Detection Model
- **Objective**: Detect soccer balls and players.
- **Training Data Description**: [Brief description of the data used for training, e.g., number of images, diversity, sources].
